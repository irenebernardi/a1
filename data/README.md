# Macaque auditory thalamocortical circuits model (/data folder)
## Description
Multiscale model of the macaque auditory thalamocortical circuits developed using NetPyNE (www.netpyne.org).

The model is described in the following preprint paper (currently under review in Nature Communications):

Dura-Bernal S, Griffith EY, Barczak A, Oâ€™Connell MN, McGinnis T, Schroeder C, Lytton WW, Lakatos P, Neymotin SA. (2022) **Data-driven multiscale model of macaque auditory thalamocortical circuits reproduces in vivo dynamics.** BioRxiv 2022.02.03.479036


## Downloading the data
All the experimental data and data generated by the model has been made publicly available online at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wSpBU6kf3aKDgh8SvUz33wxVCTNPMuo9?usp=sharing

## Overview of file structure:

The structure of the /data folder is as follows:

* /v34_batchX: Output data generated by the model simulations, and required to reproduce the paper results.

* /ICoutput: Output of phenomenological model of cochlea and inferior colliculus (UR_EAR tool) in response to input .wav sound files. Used as input to the NetPyNE-based biophysically detailed thalamocortical model.

* /NHPdata: Non-human primate experimental data used for validation of model results, and required to reproduce the paper results.
