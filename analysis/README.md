# Macaque auditory thalamocortical circuits model (/analysis folder)
## Description
Multiscale model of the macaque auditory thalamocortical circuits developed using NetPyNE (www.netpyne.org).

The model is described in the following preprint paper (currently under review in Nature Communications):

Dura-Bernal S, Griffith EY, Barczak A, Oâ€™Connell MN, McGinnis T, Schroeder C, Lytton WW, Lakatos P, Neymotin SA. (2022) **Data-driven multiscale model of macaque auditory thalamocortical circuits reproduces in vivo dynamics.** BioRxiv 2022.02.03.479036


## Setup and execution

This code can be used to reproduce the analysis and figures in the paper. It requires having access to the experimental data and data generated by the model -- see /data/README.md for instructions on how to download. 

Some analysis functions requires NetPyNE; see installations instructions here: http://netpyne.org/install.html#
